# Mystic River (2003)

Mystic river has a lot going on for it in the first third of the movie, interesting story setup, cast and the cinematography is nice. The second third has decent buildup and a bit of "misdirection" trying to set the viewer up for a big plot twist. 
Then some questionable decisions were made by the characters and it kind of went downhill from there. 
The ending pretty much ruined the movie for me, it just didnt feel very realistic or believable (e.g. Annabeth and Sean makeout scene). If Clint wanted to make the ending ambiguous, rolling the credits right after Jimmy tells Sean about David would be far
better than whatever the fuck this "parade ending" was. Also what was the point of Seans wife calling him throughout the movie like?? 
Anyway the acting was great, Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn stole the show for me, I'll have to check out more from them. 

Overall not as bad as I make it out to be, but it left me a bit unsatisfied.
